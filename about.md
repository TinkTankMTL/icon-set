The pictograms are fully open source under the GPL licence. You're welcome to use the icons for anything you want (commercial, personnal or open source projects).

###Why this project? 

OK, there's the [Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com/) and there's [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/), but we believe there's a need for something right in between. On TNP, if you download two icons, there's little chance that they'll fit together. And on FA, the icons are limited to technological stuff. 

###Who the hell is TinkTank? 

[TinkTank](http://tinktank.club) is a company based in Montreal that runs accelaration workshops for collaborative projects.
