##We need you!##

We need your help to make this project happen. 

Are you a master of Illustrator? A code ninja? Please [drop us a line](mailto:icons@tinktank.club). We'd love to hear what you have to say... 

At the moment, the site is built in Jekyll and doesn't let people upload their own icons. We've been too busy making icons to think of a better solution... 

If you want to make some icons free to the world, start by downloading our [Illustrator template](http://tinktank.club/assets/icon_template.ai) and follow those simple rules: 

- icons have to use rounded black lines with 2.5pt thickness 
- icons have to fit in a 25mm circle 
- icons have to be made by you 

Export them in png and svg and send them our way!
